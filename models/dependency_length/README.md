# Computing Dependency Length


* `computeDependencyLengths_ForGrammars.py` computes dependency length for a given grammar

* `computeDependencyLengths_Real.py` computes dependency length for orders actually observed in corpus

* `computeDependencyLengths_ForGrammars_AllLanguages.py` computes dependency length for all grammars in one of the directories in `/raw-results/`
