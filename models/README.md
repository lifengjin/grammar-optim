# Code for Running Models

Main scripts:

* `evaluate_efficiency`: evaluate the efficiency of grammars (Study 1)

* `optimize`: Optimizing grammars for efficiency, and extracting grammars from the orders found in the datasets (Studies 1 and 2).

Auxiliary scripts and supplementary experiments:

* `general`: collect optimized and random grammars in a few large tables
* `assemblePlane`: collect parseability and predictability estimates for individual grammars in a few large tables
* `chosen_hyperparameters`: hyperparameters for neural networks (Section S6)
* `corpus_reader`: utilities for reading UD corpora
* `dependency_length`: measuring dependency length of grammars (Section S10)
* `info_locality`
