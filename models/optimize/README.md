# Optimizing and Extracting Grammars

Main experiments:

* `real_grammars`: extracting grammars from actual orders occurring in corpora
* `efficiency`: optimizing grammars for efficiency

Supplementary experiments:

* `dependencyLength`, `parseability`, `predictability`: optimizing grammars for further criteria (results reported in SI Sections S4 and S10)
